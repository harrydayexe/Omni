                UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifier), also known as GUIDs
                (Globally Unique IDentifier). A UUID is 128 bits long, and can
                guarantee uniqueness across space and time. UUIDs were originally
                used in the Apollo Network Computing System and later in the Open
                Software Foundation\textbackslash{}'s (OSF) Distributed Computing
                Environment (DCE), and then in Microsoft Windows platforms. This
                specification is derived from the DCE specification with the kind
                permission of the OSF (now known as The Open Group). Information
                from earlier versions of the DCE specification have been
